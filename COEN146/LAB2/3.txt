1.  
    Step 5 - copying 100,000 Bytes file
    LAB1:

    time to copy using functions: 0.0008750
    time to copy using syscalls: 0.0007690

    LAB2:

    time to copy using functions: 0.0002730
    time to copy using syscalls: 0.0002330

    Step 5 - copying 1000,000 Bytes file
    time to copy using functions: 0.0016210
    time to copy using syscalls: 0.0017960

    LAB2: 
    time to copy using functions: 0.0009580
    time to copy using syscalls: 0.0011150


    Thus, it is quite apparent that multithreading is faster for copying the files.

2. 
    One Object: 143 ms
    Non-Persistent 6 Objects: 707 ms
    6 parallel connection - Persistent: 190 ms
    6 parallel connection - Non-Persistent: 237 ms

3. 
    e.  I notice that these two commands, when run, return the index.php page from the specified URL, compromised of HTML code.
        There is also a JavaScript portion at the top of the page. This returns code, and does not return how the page appears
        visually to a client.

    f.  i.      index.php 
        ii.     1.1
        iii.    I observed PNG and JPG, which are common image formats online. PNG was used for button pictures, as they have transparent
                backgrounds, whereas JPG was used for larger photos as it is a more compressed format, which allows the page to load faster.
