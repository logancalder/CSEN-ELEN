// Description: This file contains instructions on how to execute lab 6.

1. Log on to ECC Systems, then launch VirtualBox. From here, select Expert Mode and then navigate to Networks under Tools.
   Create a network named vboxnet0, select DHCP Server under properties, Enable Server, and Apply.

2. Start the VM and setup a password. Use passwd to configure it. Obtain the IP using ifconfig.

3. Launch FTP daemon using tcpd ftp in.ftpd.

4. Run grep "2010" /usr/src/* in the MINIX command line to obtain copyright file. Add your name to it using VI, then wq.

5. Type shutdown, then exit. Get ready to press a number to launch your custom MINIX once the reboot completes.

6. Voila, your name should appear. If not, you made a whoopsie.
